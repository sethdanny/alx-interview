# Pascal's Triangle Algorithm in Python

This project implements the Pascal's Triangle algorithm in Python. Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical triangle where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The algorithm generates and prints Pascal's Triangle with a given number of rows.

## Usage

To use the Pascal's Triangle algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sethdanny/alx-interview.git
